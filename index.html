       <p> One of my bucket list is to read a book in a magical forest like the image.
        Although, if given the choice of playing games or reading, I would choose to play on my phone.
         However, if the place is a mist covered, spooky-yet magical forest, I would no doubt say yes.</p>

        <p> My favourite subject is science. If it is more specific, space.
            I love everything about space. The beautiful planets, the mysterious 
            yet magical pitch black sky, and most importantly, the theories.
             I like to think. Usually they're thoughts that are not really
              useful in life. Every thoughts I have end at some point.
             However, space is endless. The possibilities of what might happen
              to earth and the questions of other living existence on other galaxies.
               Although I'm more of a lets-stick-to-the-ground type of person space would always be in my heart.</p>

 I love sweets. Ever since I was young, I would go out of my way to steal the last piece of pastery laid out on the table.
 I once even got in trouble for eating seven donuts in one day! I got banned from eating sweets for awhile after that. Not only do I like 
 pasteries, I like eating candy as well! Any kind of candy is big yes for me. So if you have any leftover candy, make sure you hide it from me.

I am the youngest of my siblings. Of course, because of that, I got a lot of influence of liking k-pop. Before, I was a big sucker for BTS.
Now currently, I amd hopelessly obsessed with a boy band group called Stray Kids.

Not only do I like K-pop, I like anime as well. This influence also came from my sister. Although she doesn't watch it anymore.
 Since I might go for art for my career, I love watching the smooth and beautiful animations of the characters.
