        <h2>Favourite Images</h2>

        <img src="images/forest.jpeg" height="150" width="200">
        <p>One of my bucket list is to read a book in a magical forest like the image. Although, if given the choice
            of playing games or reading, I would choose to play on my phone.
            However, if the place is a mist covered, spooky-yet magical forest, I would no doubt say yes.</p>

        <img src="images/space.jpeg" height="150" width="200">
        <p>My favourite subject is science. If it is more specific, space. I love everything about space.
            The beautiful planets, the mysterious yet magical pitch black sky, and most importantly, the
            theories. I like to think. Usually they're thoughts that are not really useful in life. Every
            thoughts I have end at some point. However, space is endless. The possibilities of what might happen
            to earth and the questions of other living existence on other galaxies. Although I'm more of a
            lets-stick-to-the-ground
            type of person space would always be in my heart.</p>

        <img src="images/yum.jpeg" height="150" width="200">
        <p>I love sweets. Ever since I was young, I would go out of my way to steal the last piece of pastery laid out
            on
            the table. I once even got in trouble for eating seven donuts in one day! I got banned from eating sweets
            for
            awhile after
            that. Not only do I like pasteries, I like eating candy as well! Any kind of candy is big yes for me. So if
            you
            have any
            leftover candy, make sure you hide it from me.</p>

        <p>I am the youngest of my siblings. Of course, because of that, I got a lot of influence of liking k-pop.
            Before,
            my favourite
            group was BTS.Now, I like a band called Stray Kids.</p>

        <img src="images/ghibili.jpeg" height="150" width="200">
        <p>Not only do I like K-pop, I like anime as well. This influence also came from my sister. Although she doesn't
            watch
            it anymore.
            Since I love to draw, it's extra fun for me to watching the animations
